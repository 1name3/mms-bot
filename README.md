# MMS.ba Auto Writer Bot

This is a simple Python bot that automatically writes text into the MMS.ba website, which is similar to a typewriter interface. It uses Chrome to interact with the site and simulates user input to complete exercises.

## Status

This project is currently a work in progress. The bot is not fully functional yet and may fail frequently. I'm actively working on improvements and bug fixes.

## Features

- Automatically writes the required text for exercises on MMS.ba
- Easy to use â€“ just run the script and select your lesson and task

- Designed for students or users who want to speed up the typing process

## Requirements

- Google Chrome installed
- ChromeDriver (make sure it matches your Chrome version)

1. Clone this repository or download the files.
2. Install the required Python libraries:

3. Download ChromeDriver and place it in the same directory as the script or set the path in the code:

## Usage

1. Run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python mms_writer_bot.py
